comments: Type code information is as follows (in Type, Name, Description
tuples):
   
  > C,Country Data,"The figure is the one produced and disseminated by the country
  > (including data adjusted BY THE COUNTRY to meet international standards)"
  > 
  > CA,Country Adjusted,"The figure is the one produced and provided by the
  > country, but adjusted by the international agency for international
  > comparability -- that is to comply with internationally agreed standards,
  > definitions and classifications (age group, ISCED, etc)"
  > 
  > E,Estimated,"The figure is estimated by the international agency, when
  > corresponding country data on a specific year or set of years are not
  > available, or when multiple sources exist, or there are issues of data quality.
  > Estimates are based on national data, such as surveys or administrative
  > records, or other sources but on the same variable being estimated."
  > 
  > M,Modeled,"The figure is modeled by the agency when there is a complete lack of
  > data on the variable being estimated. The model is based on a set of
  > covariates -- other variables for which data are available and that can
  > explain the phenomenon."
  > 
  > G,Global monitoring data,"The figure is regularly produced by the designated
  > agency for the global monitoring, based on country data. However, there is no
  > corresponding figure at the country level, because the indicator is defined for
  > international monitoring only (example: population below 1$ a day)"
  > 
  > N,Not Relevant,"The figure is not available because the indicator-as defined
  > for the global monitoring-does not apply to the circumstances of the specific
  > country, and therefore is not reported"
  > 
  > NA,Not Available,"A figure was not provided, or the "nature of data" - see
  > other colors for the definition of "nature of data" - is unknown"
