Getting Started
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Source files are kept in the src/ tree. Test harnesses are kept side by
side with the classes and functions they test with test or Test
appended to the file name.

To get started try running all the tests by doing (you may need to
first install additional libraries -- see Library Dependencies below):

$ cd test
$ python main.py test

It is suggested that you create your own local copy of main.py called,
say, main_<username>.py and modify this. DO NOT COMMIT any changes of
main.py to the repository OR ADD your own copy of main.py.
