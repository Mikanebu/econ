New Version (v0.4) of Open Economics Released

This is the fourth release of the Open Economics project and the first that has been deemed worthy of a proper release announcement. The Open Economics project provides data storage and visualization for economics data as well as associated web services and assorted modelling code. The project home page is: <http://www.okfn.org/econ/> while the open economics web interface is currently available at: <http://econ.dev.okfn.org/> (though note that we plan to move to a dedicated domain in the near future).

To see some of the features of the web interface in action check out:

Work first started on an Open Economics project back in late 2004 with some basic modelling code. Since then, especially with work over the last year or so, it has expanded considerably to be both a resource in its own right and another experiment into what a knowledge package would look like. At present it consists of 3 components:

  1. A python library for building economics models
  2. A set of data (under trunk/data) along with 
  3. A web interface for access the data store, visualizing the data and providing various simple 'web services'

Finally, we should mention that the project is looking for contributors. Areas in which assistance would be valuable include:

  * Uploading and creating data
  * Improving code (python)
  * Setting up a project blog/website
  * Improving web frontend to services and data store
